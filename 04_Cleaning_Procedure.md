# **4. Cleaning Procedure**  

## **4.1. Wetting the Dog**  
- Begin from the neck down to avoid startling the dog.  
- Avoid direct water spray on the face or ears.  

## **4.2. Shampooing**  
1. Dilute shampoo in a 1:4 ratio (1 part shampoo, 4 parts water) for even distribution.  
2. Massage shampoo into the coat in circular motions, working from the neck to the tail.  
3. Pay special attention to areas prone to dirt (e.g., paws, belly, under the tail).  

## **4.3. Rinsing**  
- Rinse thoroughly until water runs clear to prevent residue buildup.  

## **4.4. Facial Cleaning**  
- Use a damp cloth or sponge. Avoid getting soap or water into the dogâ€™s eyes, ears, or nostrils.  

## **4.5. Conditioning (Optional)**  
- Apply conditioner, leave for 2-3 minutes, and rinse thoroughly.
