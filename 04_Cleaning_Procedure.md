# **4. Cleaning Procedure**

_This section delineates the standardized methodology for the canine cleaning process, ensuring adherence to best practices that promote the health, safety, and comfort of the animal._

## **4.1. Wetting the Canine**

Prior to the application of cleansing agents, it is essential to thoroughly wet the canine's coat to facilitate effective cleaning.

- **Initiation of Wetting Process**: Commence the wetting procedure at the cervical region (neck area), progressing caudally towards the tail. This approach minimizes the likelihood of startling the canine and promotes a calm demeanor.
    
- **Facial and Auricular Precautions**: Exercise caution to prevent direct exposure of the facial and auricular (ear) regions to water spray. Direct contact with these sensitive areas may induce discomfort or distress in the canine.
    

## **4.2. Application of Cleansing Agent (Shampooing)**

The application of shampoo is a critical component of the cleaning procedure, necessitating careful attention to ensure efficacy and safety.

1. **Dilution Protocol**: Prepare the shampoo solution by diluting one part shampoo with four parts water (1:4 ratio). This dilution facilitates even distribution and reduces the risk of skin irritation.
    
2. **Method of Application**: Apply the diluted shampoo to the canine's coat, initiating at the neck and proceeding towards the tail. Employ gentle, circular massaging motions to work the shampoo into a lather, ensuring thorough coverage of the entire coat.
    
3. **Attention to High-Soil Areas**: Allocate additional attention to regions prone to increased soiling, including the paws, ventral abdomen (belly), and perianal area (under the tail).
    

## **4.3. Rinsing Procedure**

Proper rinsing is imperative to remove all traces of shampoo, thereby preventing potential skin irritation or residue buildup.

- **Rinsing Technique**: Utilize lukewarm water to rinse the canine's coat thoroughly. Continue the rinsing process until the effluent water is devoid of soap residue and runs clear, indicating complete removal of the cleansing agent.

## **4.4. Facial Cleaning Protocol**

The facial region requires specialized attention due to its sensitivity and the presence of sensory organs.

- **Cleaning Methodology**: Employ a damp, soft cloth or sponge to gently cleanse the facial area. Avoid the introduction of soap or excessive moisture into the eyes, ears, or nostrils to prevent discomfort or potential health issues.

## **4.5. Application of Conditioning Agent (Optional)**

The use of a conditioning agent may be considered to enhance coat manageability and health.

- **Conditioner Application**: Apply the conditioner uniformly across the canine's coat following the shampooing and rinsing stages.
    
- **Dwell Time**: Allow the conditioner to remain on the coat for a duration of two to three minutes to achieve optimal efficacy.
    
- **Final Rinse**: Conduct a thorough rinse to remove all conditioner residues, ensuring the water runs clear.
    

By adhering to this standardized cleaning procedure, practitioners can ensure a safe, effective, and humane cleansing process that upholds the welfare of the canine subject.
