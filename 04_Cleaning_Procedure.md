# **4. Cleaning Procedure**
_This section outlines the standardized methodology for the canine cleaning process, ensuring adherence to best practices that promote the health, safety, and comfort of the animal._

## **4.1. Wetting the Canine**

Prior to applying cleansing agents, it is essential to thoroughly wet the canine's coat to facilitate effective cleaning.

- **Initiation of Wetting Process**: Commence the wetting procedure at the cervical region (neck area) and progress caudally toward the tail. This approach minimizes the likelihood of startling the canine and promotes a calm demeanor.
  
- **Facial and Auricular Precautions**: Exercise caution to prevent direct water spray exposure to the facial and auricular (ear) regions. Contact with these sensitive areas may cause discomfort or distress.

## **4.2. Application of Cleansing Agent (Shampooing)**

The application of shampoo is a critical component of the cleaning procedure, requiring careful attention to ensure both efficacy and safety.

1. **Dilution Protocol**: Prepare the shampoo solution by diluting one part shampoo with four parts water (1:4 ratio). This dilution facilitates even distribution and reduces the risk of skin irritation.

2. **Method of Application**: Apply the diluted shampoo to the canine's coat starting at the neck and proceeding toward the tail. Employ gentle, circular massaging motions to work the shampoo into a lather, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the entire coat.

3. **Attention to High-Soil Areas**: Allocate additional attention to areas prone to increased soiling, such as the paws, ventral abdomen (belly), and perianal region (under the tail).

## **4.3. Rinsing Procedure**

Proper rinsing is imperative to remove all traces of shampoo and prevent potential skin irritation or residue buildup.

- **Rinsing Technique**: Use lukewarm water to rinse the canine’s coat thoroughly. Continue rinsing until the effluent water is free of soap residue and runs clear, indicating complete removal of the cleansing agent.

## **4.4. Facial Cleaning Protocol**

Due to its sensitivity and the presence of sensory organs, the facial region requires specialized attention.

- **Cleaning Methodology**: Use a damp, soft cloth or sponge to gently cleanse the facial area. Avoid introducing soap or excessive moisture into the eyes, ears, or nostrils to prevent discomfort or potential health issues.

## **4.5. Application of Conditioning Agent (Optional)**

The use of a conditioning agent may be considered to enhance coat manageability and overall health.

- **Conditioner Application**: Uniformly apply the conditioner across the canine’s coat following the shampooing and rinsing stages.

- **Dwell Time**: Allow the conditioner to remain on the coat for two to three minutes to achieve optimal efficacy.

- **Final Rinse**: Perform a thorough rinse to remove all conditioner residues, ensuring that the water runs clear.

By adhering to this standardized cleaning procedure, practitioners can ensure a safe, effective, and humane cleansing process that upholds the welfare of the canine subject.
