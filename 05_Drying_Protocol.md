# **5. Drying Protocol**

## **5.1. Towel Drying**
- Pat dry using an absorbent towel. Avoid vigorous rubbing to prevent matting or irritation.
- Use a washable towel that has been laundered with mild detergent at a minimum temperature of 60 °C.
- See also [Post Cleaning Care](06_Post-Cleaning_Care.md).

## **5.2. Air or Blow-Drying**
- Use a low-heat setting and maintain a safe distance (20–30 cm).
- The temperature should not exceed 45 °C, and the airflow must remain below 20 m/s.
- Always dry from top to bottom.
- If the dog exhibits aggressive, frightened, or nervous behavior in response to the hairdryer's noise, revert to **Towel Drying** to ensure the safety of both the animal and the operator.

## **5.3. Drying Environment**
- The drying process should occur in an environment maintained between 15 and 25 °C.
