# **The Canine Cleansing Standard (CCS-2025)**  
A systematic guide to maintaining optimal cleanliness and hygiene for your dog.
### Disclaimer:
This is a fictive Standard to show case how to develop a standard using [GitHub](https://github.com/danielsiegl/CanineCleansingStandard), [SmartGit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).<br>
Published version: [https://danielsiegl.github.io/CanineCleansingStandard/](https://danielsiegl.github.io/CanineCleansingStandard/)

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is used to render the content of the Standard also into PDF using a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/danielsiegl/CanineCleansingStandard/actions/workflows/create-pdf-document.yml)
To achieve this the pages of the standard are concatenated into a single markdown file and enriched by a Latex header from a file.

# Why Creating Standards with GitHub is a Smart Choice

In today's fast-paced digital world, collaboration and transparency are key to creating effective industry standards. Whether in software development, engineering, or even niche areas like canine hygiene (yes, there’s a standard for that!), using GitHub to develop and publish standards provides numerous advantages.

A great example of this approach is the **Canine Cleansing Standard** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/danielsiegl/CanineCleansingStandard), [GitHub Pages](https://danielsiegl.github.io/CanineCleansingStandard/)), which demonstrates how GitHub can be used to create, manage, and publish structured standards efficiently. Here’s why you should consider this method for your own standardization efforts:

## 1. **Collaborative Development**

GitHub enables multiple contributors to collaborate on a standard, ensuring that it evolves with input from experts across the industry. Features like pull requests, issue tracking, and discussions make it easy to review, refine, and enhance content over time.

## 2. **Version Control and Transparency**

With GitHub, every change is tracked, allowing for complete transparency and accountability. Stakeholders can see exactly how a standard has evolved, compare versions, and even revert changes if needed. This ensures that updates are well-documented and auditable.

## 3. **Automated Publishing with GitHub Pages**

Once a standard is developed, GitHub Pages provides a simple yet powerful way to publish it as a professional-looking website. This makes the standard easily accessible to all stakeholders without requiring additional hosting services or complex deployments.

## 4. **PDF Generation for Formal Releases**

By leveraging GitHub’s release system, organizations can generate and distribute PDF versions of a standard. This ensures that official versions are clearly defined and easily downloadable for offline use or regulatory compliance.

## 5. **Community Engagement and Open Contributions**

GitHub fosters an open-source mentality, allowing a broader community to provide feedback and suggestions. This openness leads to higher adoption rates and stronger standards that reflect real-world needs.

## 6. **Automation and Continuous Improvement**

Through GitHub Actions and other automation tools, organizations can validate content, generate PDFs on release, and even integrate testing mechanisms to ensure consistency and quality in the standard’s development.

## Conclusion

Whether you’re developing a technical specification, an industry guideline, or even a standard for dog grooming best practices, GitHub provides a modern, transparent, and efficient way to create, manage, and publish standards. By embracing GitHub and GitHub Pages, organizations can foster better collaboration, ensure long-term accessibility, and establish clear, well-documented best practices that stand the test of time.
