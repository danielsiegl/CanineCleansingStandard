# **The Canine Cleansing Standard (CCS-2025)**  
A systematic guide to maintaining optimal cleanliness and hygiene for your dog.
### Disclaimer:
This is a fictive Standard to show case how to develop a standard using [GitHub](https://github.com/danielsiegl/CanineCleansingStandard), [SmartGit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).<br>
Published version: [https://danielsiegl.github.io/CanineCleansingStandard/](https://danielsiegl.github.io/CanineCleansingStandard/)

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is used to render the content of the Standard also into PDF using a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/danielsiegl/CanineCleansingStandard/actions/workflows/create-pdf-document.yml)
To achieve this the pages of the standard are concatenated into a single markdown file and enriched by a Latex header from a file.
