# **1. Purpose**

The Canine Cleansing Standard (CCS-2025) is established to provide a comprehensive framework for the effective and humane cleaning of canines. This standard aims to:

- **Ensure Effective Cleaning**: Provide guidelines that guarantee thorough cleanliness of dogs, thereby promoting their overall health and well-being.
    
- **Minimize Discomfort**: Outline procedures that reduce any potential discomfort or stress experienced by dogs during the cleaning process.
    
- **Promote Health and Well-being**: Advocate for practices that support the physical health and psychological comfort of canines.
    

This standard is applicable to all dog breeds, sizes, and coat types, ensuring inclusivity and comprehensive coverage across the canine population.

Additionally, CCS-2025 serves as a model to demonstrate the development of standards utilizing modern toolchains, including platforms such as GitHub, SmartGit, and Obsidian. This approach underscores the importance of leveraging contemporary technologies to enhance collaboration, version control, and documentation in the standards development process.

By adhering to the guidelines set forth in CCS-2025, practitioners can ensure that canine cleaning practices are both effective and humane, thereby contributing to the health and well-being of dogs.
