# **1. Purpose**

The Canine Cleansing Standard (CCS-2025) establishes a comprehensive framework for the effective and humane cleaning of canines. This standard aims to:

- **Ensure Effective Cleaning:** Provide guidelines that guarantee the thorough removal of contaminants from dogs, thereby promoting their overall health and well-being.
- **Minimize Discomfort:** Outline procedures designed to reduce any potential discomfort or stress experienced by dogs during the cleaning process.
- **Promote Health and Well-being:** Advocate for practices that support both the physical health and psychological comfort of canines.

CCS-2025 applies to all dog breeds, sizes, and coat types, ensuring inclusivity and comprehensive coverage of the canine population.

Additionally, CCS-2025 serves as a model for developing standards using modern toolchains, including platforms such as GitHub, SmartGit, and Obsidian. This approach underscores the importance of leveraging contemporary technologies to enhance collaboration, version control, and documentation during the standards development process.

By adhering to the guidelines set forth in CCS-2025, practitioners can ensure that canine cleaning practices are both effective and humane, ultimately contributing to the overall health and well-being of dogs.
