# **2. Equipment Standards**  
## **2.1. Cleaning Supplies**  
- **Shampoo:** Dog-specific, hypoallergenic, pH-balanced for canine skin (5.5–7.2 pH).  
- **Conditioner (Optional):** Hydrating, detangling for long coats.  
- **Brush:** Coat-type specific (e.g., slicker brushes for long hair, rubber curry combs for short hair).  
- **Towels:** Soft, absorbent, microfiber preferred.

## **2.2. Water Quality and Temperature**  
- Clean, potable water between 37°C–39°C (98.6°F–102°F) to avoid thermal shock or burns.  

## **2.3. Safety Gear**  
- Anti-slip mat in bathing area.  
- Gentle restraint (optional) to keep the dog secure.
  
## **2.4 Bathing Supplies**
- Rinse Cup or Spray Hose: For easy and thorough rinsing during baths.
- Non-Slip Mat: To ensure your dog doesn't slip in the tub or bathing area.
- Dryer: A pet-specific dryer with low heat and noise settings to dry the coat quickly and safely. Avoid human hairdryers as they can be too hot.
